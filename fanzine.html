<h2>Jaeger counter (1982-2012)</h2> 

<p class="hyphenate text" lang="en">Gustav Jaeger (1925-2010) is unintentionally and indirectly associed with the identity of one of the most famous international wordmark. Since 1999, at the initiative of the designer <a href="http://www.kedardesigns.com/" target="blank">Ruth Kedar</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/" target="blank">Google</a> uses for its logo the <a href="http://www.linotype.com/508547/CatullProBQ-product.html" target="blank">Catull</a> typeface by this German typographer and type designer. 
The <span class="donthyphenate"><i>Catull</i></span> typeface was published by Berthold in 1982.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="hyphenate text" lang="en">30 years after the release of <i>Catull</i>, it seemed interesting to discover the work of G. Jaeger. At the end of the text, we will talk about the use of <i>Catull</i> by Google.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="hyphenate text" lang="en">Born in 1925, Gustav Jaeger is the son of a printer. He studied at the Hochschule für Gestaltung Offenbach am Main<sup><a href="#00001" id="fn1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p class="hyphenate text" lang="en">He was soon spotted by Konrad F. Bauer (1903-1970) and Walter Baum (1921-2007) and joined the prestigious Bauer typefoundry<sup><a href="#00002" id="fn2">2</a></sup> in order to design type specimens. We can presume that Jaeger worked for the promotion of <a href="http://www.linotype.com/1084006/Folio-family.html" target="blank">Folio</a>, <a href="http://www.linotype.com/345681/Volta-family.html" target="blank">Volta</a> or <a href="http://www.linotype.com/861/Impressum-family.html" target="blank">Impressum</a> typefaces<sup><a href="#00003" id="fn3">3</a></sup>, all co-created by Bauer and Baum during the 50s and 60s. Jaeger possibly remained in that position until the death of Bauer or until the end of the foundry in 1972.</p>

<p class="hyphenate text" lang="en">Encouraged by Bauer, Jaeger had fortunately started his retraining and began to create his own typefaces. Jaeger was a typographer, he became a type designer, he started making titling typefaces for the prestigious Berthold typefoundry. In 1973, he published his first typefaces: <i>Jumbo</i>, <i>Pinocchio</i>, <i>Mark Twain</i> and <i>Sacher</i>. Follow the <i>Komet</i> and <i>Semin-Antiqua</i>, both published in 1976<sup><a href="#00004" id="fn4">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p class="hyphenate text" lang="en">1977 is a year of transition, at 52 (!), Gustav Jaeger publishes his first text typeface <a href="http://www.linotype.com/fr/792800/SenecaBQVolume-product.html" target="blank">Seneca</a>. With three exceptions
(<a href="http://www.linotype.com/fr/9471/BecketProRegular-product.html" target="blank">Becket</a> in 1980 for Linotype, <a href="http://www.linotype.com/fr/265002/AjaBQPopplExquisitBQVolume-product.html" target="blank">Aja</a> in 1981 and <a href="http://www.linotype.com/fr/265249/BellevueBQBoulevardBQBertholdScriptBQVolume-product.html" target="blank">Bellevue</a> in 1986), Jaeger would only design from then text typefaces. In the 80s, he published his major works:
<a href="http://www.linotype.com/508458/CosmosProBQ-product.html" target="blank">Cosmos</a> and <a href="http://www.linotype.com/508547/CatullProBQ-product.html" target="blank">Catull</a> in 1982, <a href="http://www.linotype.com/fr/792709/JaegerAntiquaBQVolume-valuepack.html" target="blank">Jaeger-Antiqua</a> in 1984<sup><a href="#00005" id="fn5">5</a></sup> and <a href="http://www.fonts.com/font/berthold/chasseur-bq" target="blank">Chasseur</a> in 1988.</p>

<p class="hyphenate text" lang="en">His career seems to have stopped in 1990 with the publication of <a href="http://www.linotype.com/792611/DonatusBQVolume-product.html" target="blank"><span class="donthyphenate">Donatus</span></a> and
<a href="http://www.linotype.com/261406/PradoBQ-family.html?site=valuepacks" target="blank">Prado</a>.</p>

<p class="hyphenate text" lang="en">In 1993, Berthold typefoundry went bankrupt. In 1991, Berthold had signed a distribution agreement with Adobe for a portion of its typefaces.  In 1997, Hunt recovered the full Berthold type collection.  Since 2008, Linotype also distributes some Berthold typefaces. The distribution agreement between Adobe and Berthold probably helped the memory of the Berthold legacy. Presumably the presence of <i>Catull</i> among the fonts distributed by Adobe, a company for which Ruth Kedar works regularly when she was approached by Larry Page and Sergey Brin on the campus of Stanford, had significant impact on her choice.

The use of <i>Catull</i> for Google logo obviously contributed greatly to the fame of this typeface and to Jaeger’s himself to a lesser extent, ironically<sup><a href="#00006" id="fn6">6</a></sup>, nine years after his last release and six years after the end of Berthold AG.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="hyphenate text" lang="en">As for <a href="http://www.mactrast.com/2011/04/apples-first-ever-logo/" target="blank">early Apple</a>, we can guess a traditionalist qualm from Google, as Ruth Kedar confirms.</p>

<p class="hyphenate text" lang="en" style="font-size:90%"><i>Times-Roman</i> was the font of choice for the web at that time, while sans-serif fonts were the darling of the printed world. I wanted the readability of a serifed font, but looked for a typeface that had the same qualities we were looking for — subtly sophisticated, but with some humor and irreverence. The chosen typeface is a based on <i>Catull</i>, an old style serif typeface. <i>Catull</i> borrows elements from traditional writing instruments such as the quill and the chisel with a modern twist. Search, by nature, is an activity that requires we look into the past. Therefore Catull’s historical ties seemed appropriate, as did the bridging between the old analog world and the new emerging digital era<sup><a href="#00007" id="fn7">7</a></sup>.</fn></p>

<p class="hyphenate text" lang="en">Thus, as if technology, seeking legitimacy or respectability denied a bit of itself, Google opted for a deliberately classic typographic embodiment. 
There is indeed nothing futuristic or even contemporary in <i>Catull</i>. Instead, like 
most Berthold typefaces (except some rare remaining titling typefaces), <i>Catull</i> seems timeless. Its so specific lowercase “a”, missing in the name “Google” cannot hide a typographical writing combined with the perpetual present.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="hyphenate text" lang="en">The case of Gustav Jaeger, late bloomer, is food for thought. We discover a work of remarkable consistency and sustainability, when 85 years appear to be 30, when in front of a present shock, we are asking Google for our lost time.</p>

it is stated that Alexander Branczyk, also a student at the School of Offenbach am Main, has produced this typeface designed by Jaeger.
